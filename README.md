# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

## What’s Covered

- A quick introduction to the notebook
- Popular programming languages used by data scientists
- Commonly used data science libraries
- A short list of tools used in the data science ecosystem
- A basic example of arithmetic operations using Python
- Markdown formatting practice (lists, tables, headers, etc.)
- A couple of simple Python code cells for practice

## Why I made this notebook

This notebook was created as a hands-on exercise to practice using Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown, and to get comfortable with writing and organizing data science content in a clean and structured way. It’s also a good intro to how notebooks can be used in real-world data science work.
